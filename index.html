    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the official ASR website! The Axos Socialist Republic is a Minecraft empire based on the server <strike>REDACTED</strike>.
        Founded on June 15th 2025 by Lordos Axos, or AxoFX. The capital of the ASR is Axford, one of the largest cities on the server.
        Well known for being far more advanced than its counterparts in organization, innovation, and leadership.

    <h2>Ranking</h2>

    <p>
        The ASR has a complex ranking system based around legions further broken down into divisions. At the very top are the
        <strong>Lord, Admiral, and Alligant General</strong>; together they lead the ASR to a brighter, socialist, future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below them are the <strong>Militant Director</strong> and the <strong>Civil Director</strong>, who use scientific research to benefit the public and the military.
        Then there are the <strong>Generals</strong>, there are 3 and each leads a legion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Generals lead the <strong>Commanders</strong>; there are three of them in each legion. Each Commander leads a division:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground Force</li>
        <li>Air Force</li>
        <li>Sea Force</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Within the divisions are <strong>Soldiers</strong>, they have some combat training and environment training (based off their division speciality).
        And finally, below Commanders and equal to the Soldiers are <strong>Civilians</strong>, simple unranked people who are the most vital part of the ASR.

    <h2>Prefecture</h2>
    <p>
        The ASR consists of Prefectures, smaller areas or districts of the greater empire. The main Prefecture is
        <strong>Axfordshire</strong>, obviously surrounding Axford. Generally, each Prefecture has its own sub‑capital. However, they are all administered directly from Axford.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connecting the Prefectures are four classes of roads, canals, railways, and telegraphs. Road classes are indicated by a coloured stripe down the middle of it:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Red</strong> — Small, 2 lanes</li>
        <li><strong>Orange</strong> — Large, 4 lanes</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow</strong> — Speedway, 2 ice tracks</li>
        <li><strong>Unclassed</strong> — Rare, usually 2 lanes, no stripe</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Media</h2>
    <p>
        The ASR has many forms of media, such as documents, spreadsheets, images, and videos. Most of these have copyright
        protection, so please do not violate it. This website in fact has copyright protection, noted at the bottom of the page.
        With other forms of media videos may have a copyright disclaimer at the beginning, spreadsheets may have it noted at the top,
        and images will have the copyright noted as a description or at the back of the document its in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some media is also classified such as research documents we do not want enemies to see; these will have copyright on them and a
        note at the top saying “CLASSIFIED” and just below that the minimum rank requirement to read it. Reading, owning, giving, or 
        buying these documents is a violation of ASR Law.
