    <h2>LDP Win election! | 27/01/2026 | The Sentry</h2>
    <p>Today, MOUSE_bootless is officially, the President of the Axian Republic! With 88.9% of votes and only 1 vote for the opposition this kind of win may never be seen again. Tommorow the first policies are to come through and change the political landscape for the civilians of Axia. MOUSE_bootless's term as President will end if: She is unable to continue, She has been President for 3 months, She has a criminal record, or The Sentry are forced to remove her. Obviously, it is unlikely any of these will happen so just in case, the President will be asked to choose a Vice President for the party. The Military are also seeking funding from the LDP party to create a 4 way flying machine for their "shady" operations to expand both south-east and north-west.</p>

    <h2>Election to close Tuesday | 26/1/2026 | The Sentry</h2>
    <p>Tommorow, the Axian presidential election will close! The predictions are showing an LDP landslide at 88.9% of votes in favor of MOUSE_bootless, her Presidency is scheduled to take affect on Wednesday and the first policies will be discussed. MOUSE_bootless will notably also be the first President in Axian history. Hopefully, under LDP the Civilian population will be working less for the government and the working-crisis will end.</p>

    <h2>Plans for new ASR office building | 24/1/2026 | Military</h2>
    <p>The Military have recently revealed plans to construct a large new office building in the southern district of Axford. The building will occupy an entire block and will house all the Military projects, Civil projects, and main-branch projects. Given the current situation of Civilians filling the gaps which the stressing government have not been able to do, this building and the officials working in it will be able to relive the heavy work from the people. There are currently no objections to the construction of this building however the cost of its construction may take a chunk out of the negligible civil service funding. There are also some reservations from the government around the amount of space required may be used better for residential zones given the rapidly increasing population of 60. Its predicted by the Sentry that in the next 2 weeks the population may vastly increase above 100 if the country, Hillside, joins the ASR. Axford runway may also be housed on the site to save space, the Community Policing (main branch) have not commented on their relocation to the building but the projects that choose to relocate will be given higher funding to cope with the growing civilian population. The Lord has also announced that the ASR is to increase its military size and strength in the next few days to prepare for a large "dynamic push" into unexplored indigenous land between Brokenwood, Axford, and Ft. Razal.</p>

    <h2>Next-gen ASR cartography | 20/1/2026 | Military </h2>
    <p>Recently the ASR military have developed a python software program that allows the visualization of ASR territories in relation to eachother. This next-gen technology is currently not open to the public however its capabilities would revolutionize international travel and prevent any navigation errors. Currently there is little civilian interest in the software however the benefits would be phenomenal. Right now the software is capable of rendering polygons to mark roads and territories and soon even aerial photography may become possible.</p>

    <h2>Member count hits 50 | 19/1/2026 | The Sentry</h2>
    <p>Across the Axos Socialist Republic the member count has gone through the roof in the past week. Yesterday the ASR attempted a "control band" from Axford all the way to Brokenwood. This was not so sucessful however it gave a greater understanding of the world around us and greatly contributed to Axian Cartography. A large sea previously unexplored was also discovered and coined "Sea of Herobrine" by one of the civilians in the convoy. Recently the ASR has hit the +200% productivity target and with all the expansion going on and the member count this high the ASR may vastly grow in popularity in the coming weeks and more territories may be collected.</p>

    <h2>Axian Republic Presidential Election | 19/1/2026 | The Sentry</h2>
    <p>Recently the Lord has opened an election for a President of Axia. Generally not understood, the ASR consists of other nations/republics, then below that are Prefectures of nations, then provinces are the same level but disconnected. The president, will be the president of all current prefectures and provinces under the Axian Republic, however not other nations part of the ASR. Currently MOUSE_bootless is leading with 75% of votes and in charge of the liberal democratic party [LDP]. Her opponent, _tobuy2549, is 25% of votes and leading his own unnamed party. The LDP has made several promises to make the legal system more fair for all people under the ASR, get the public rights to more land, and make Axia more tidy and presentable. The Lord has actually voted for the LDP party "Personally, I'm voting for Mouse, she has good intention and enough favor to do the people good, in this day and age we'd be lucky to have someone like her.", yet the Admiral and Allegiant General have not yet voted and we will be expecting their votes within the next few days.</p>
