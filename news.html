    <h2>Member count hits 50 | 19/1/2026 | The Sentry</h2>
    <p>Across the Axos Socialist Republic the member count has gone through the roof in the past week. Yesterday the ASR attempted a "control band" from Axford all the way to Brokenwood. This was not so sucessful however it gave a greater understanding of the world around us and greatly contributed to Axian Cartography. A large sea previously unexplored was also discovered and coined "Sea of Herobrine" by one of the civilians in the convoy. Recently the ASR has hit the +200% productivity target and with all the expansion going on and the member count this high the ASR may vastly grow in popularity in the coming weeks and more territories may be collected.</p>

    <h2>Axian Republic Presidential Election | 19/1/2026 | The Sentry</h2>
    <p>Recently the Lord has opened an election for a President of Axia. Generally not understood, the ASR consists of other nations/republics, then below that are Prefectures of nations, then provinces are the same level but disconnected. The president, will be the president of all current prefectures and provinces under the Axian Republic, however not other nations part of the ASR. Currently MOUSE_bootless is leading with 75% of votes and in charge of the leading democratic party [LDP]. His opponent, _tobuy2549, is 25% of votes and leading his own unnamed party. The LDP has made several promises to make the legal system more fair for all people under the ASR, get the public rights to more land, and make Axia more tidy and presentable. The Lord has actually voted for the LDP party "Personally, I'm voting for Mouse, he has good intention and enough favor to do the people good, in this day and age we'd be lucky to have someone like him.", yet the Admiral and Allegiant General have not yet voted and we will be expecting their votes within the next few days.</p>
